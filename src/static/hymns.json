        "Before the hills in order stood,\nor earth received its frame,\nfrom everlasting you are God,\nto endless years the same.",
        "A thousand ages in your sight\nare like an evening gone,\nshort as the watch that ends the night\nbefore the rising sun.",
        "Time, like an ever-rolling stream,\nsoon bears us all away.\nWe fly forgotten, as a dream\ndies at the op’ning day.",
        "O God, our help in ages past,\nour hope for years to come,\nstill be our guard while troubles last,\nand our eternal home."
