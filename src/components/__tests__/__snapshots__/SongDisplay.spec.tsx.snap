          Verse 1
        </span>
        There was one who was willing to die in my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live,
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
All the sins of my life to forgive.

          Chorus
        </span>
        They are nailed to the Cross, they are nailed to the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss, Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.

          Verse 2
        </span>
        He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of its dross,
But there's no condemnation, I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross.

          Verse 3
        </span>
        I will cling to my Saviour and never depart,
I will joyfully journey each day,
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.
