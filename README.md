# Hymns for all Times

![Social Banner](./public/social_banner_1.jpg)

A modern, react-powered single page application, allowing users to ditch their paper hymnals in favor of something portable. Built with Typescript, a few other awesome libraries have helped bring this project to life, including Chakra UI, FuseJS and localforage.

While this particular version is built with a specific object structure in mind (Songs), it is absolutely flexible enough to work with other setups, provided you update the types.

This application supports dark mode and will adapt to your device preferences.

## Copyright

I claim no ownership to any of the included song lyrics. If you are the copyright holder to any of these songs, and you'd like them to be removed, please open an issue or send me an email at keno@claytoninnovations.com.

This project will in no way seek any form of monetization and is just a fun side project.

## Development

Get started by ensuring you have an up-to-date version of `node` (14.15 LTS is recommended) with `yarn` installed.

- `yarn install` to get the latest dependencies installed locally
- `yarn start` - Launches the development server
- `yarn test` - Will run jest for testing
- `yarn build` - Will compile the production version of the website
- `yarn analyze` - Will analyze a compiled build folder from the step above and give you insight into how large the bundles are.
